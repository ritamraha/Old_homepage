# YIQ Color Contrast

A naive approach to determing whether a color is "light" or "dark" by checking the lightness value in the HSL color space. It works sometimes, but often produces color pairings that - while technically correct - just look a little "off". The reason for this is that the eye is more sensitive to changes in the orange-blue range than in the purple-green range, so the percieved lightness of a color can change depending its wavelength.

The YIQ color space is designed to take this bias into account. It weighs the different parts of the color according to their impact on our perpection of the color's brightness. By utilizing this color space when doing contrast comparison, the result is a color pairing that appears more natural.

## Installation options

### NPM

  ```
  npm install sass-yiq
  ```

### Bower

  ```
  bower install sass-yiq
  ```

## Usage

  ```scss
  @import 'yiq-color-contrast'
  ```
  
### Configurable Variables

All configuration variables are assigned with the `!default` flag, so they may be overriden in your project stylesheet.

  ```scss
  $yiq-contrasted-dark-default: #000;
  ```

The text color to be used when a background is determined to be "light"

  ```scss
  $yiq-contrasted-light-default: #fff;
  ```

The text color to be used when a background is determined to be "dark"

  ```scss
  $yiq-contrasted-threshold: 128;
  ```

A a value between 0 and 255. It determines when the lightness of color changes from "dark" to "light".

  ```scss
  $yiq-debug: false;
  ```

Toggles diagnostic messages.

### Functions

  ```scss
  yiq-is-light($color, [$threshold])
  ```

Returns `true` if the color is "light" or `false` if it is "dark".

  ```scss
  yiq-contrast-color($color, [$dark], [$light], [$threshold])
  ```

Returns the `$light` color when the `$color` is dark and the `$dark` color when the `$color` is light. The `$threshold` is a value between 0 and 255 and it determines when the lightness of `$color` changes from "dark" to "light".

### Mixins

  ```scss
  @include yiq-contrasted($background-color, [$dark], [$light], [$threshold])
  ```

Sets the specified background color and calculates a dark or light contrasted text color. The arguments are passed through to the `yiq-contrast-color function`.
